# Hi, I'm Rawat 👋

I'm diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence — learning, building, and experimenting as I go.

Right now, I'm focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. I'm not an expert (yet), but I'm putting in the work and sharing everything I build here.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Working On
- Learning PyTorch and neural networks
- Exploring NLP and large language models
- Building small AI apps and tools
- Documenting everything in my repo: [boomAi](https://github.com/rawatBoi/boomAi)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech I Use

- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- PyTorch, TensorFlow (still comparing the two)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Jupyter, Google Colab
- Git & GitHub

## 🛠️ Projects

| Project | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| [boomAi](https://github.com/rawatBoi/boomAi) | My learning playground — models, experiments, notes |
| Mini-Chatbot | Simple NLP chatbot (coming soon) |
| Style Transfer | Turn images into AI art (in progress) |

---

## 🔍 Goals for 2025
- Build a portfolio of real AI projects
- Complete fast.ai and Hugging Face courses
- Create something useful with an LLM
- Contribute to open source AI tools

If you're also into AI or just curious, feel free to connect.  
I'm here to learn, build, and share — one model at a time.
